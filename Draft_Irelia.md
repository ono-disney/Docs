Q:
- Combo:
  Regular behaviour: It will prioritice heroes with mark, then kilable minions in suitable situations to increase stacks / gap close
- Harass: Same like combo
- Prevent under tower: Prevents usage if enemy is under tower and lmb is not pressed and you are not under tower already. 

- Bridge Logic:
   If bridge logic is on: The script will find ways to traverse through the wave until reaching the target (if possible)
   Require E: Will require E to be ready to start logic
   Greedy Health Pred: Takes into account incoming dmg / dash time to perform the execute minion calc. Makes Q clear faster, but also might miss the execution sometimes. Disabled by default, greedy feature.

- Semi-Manual Cast: Same like legit cast but assists you with it redirecting the cast to the best unit.
PVE:
- Last Hit: This is for unkilable units (out of range, can't kill with AA). (Works in ECO aswell)
- Lane Clear: Just normal wave clear. (Needs TURBO clear activated)
For quick Q PVE usage you need to use aggro mode.
W: 
- Aggressive: (Combo only) will use the spell to increase passive stacks mainly.
- Use For Minion Bridge Logic: Will use the spell to get minions low enough to start Q bridge logic, in case they were not low enough already.
- Defensive: Should be triggered rarely, only for incoming targeted spells that deal a big amount of damage.
E:
- Enable/Disable (Always enabled recommended)
- Request Cast: Ideal for running away.
R: 
- Request Cast: Requests cast, then the spell will be casted when a good situation is found.
- Flash + R: Requests flash + R. When a good situation is found, the logic will be run.
