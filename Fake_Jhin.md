Understanding Jhin's Abilities:

Passive - Whisper: Jhin's basic attacks utilize an ammunition system that scales with his total attack damage. He has four shots, the last of which is a guaranteed critical strike that deals bonus damage based on the target's missing health. Reloading takes a short time, during which Jhin cannot attack.

Q - Dancing Grenade: Jhin throws a bouncing grenade that can hit up to four enemies, dealing increased damage for each enemy killed by the grenade.

W - Deadly Flourish: A long-range linear skill shot that roots enemies if they have been recently damaged by Jhin or his allies, also granting him a brief moment of vision on the target.

E - Captive Audience: Jhin places a trap on the ground that, when triggered, slows enemies and then detonates after a short delay, dealing damage. If an enemy champion is killed, they also leave behind a trap.

R - Curtain Call: Jhin channels and gains the ability to shoot four powerful long-range shots, with the last shot being a guaranteed critical hit. Each shot deals damage based on the target's missing health.

Laning Phase:

Focus on farming and landing the fourth shot from your passive on the enemy ADC or support to harass them.
Use your Q to poke and wave clear. Try to bounce it off low-health minions for increased damage.
Use your W to follow up on your support's crowd control or to snipe low-health enemies.
Place E traps in bushes or choke points to control the enemy's movement.
Mid-Game and Teamfights:

Position yourself safely in teamfights, using your range advantage.
Use your R to initiate fights or to finish off low-health enemies.
Prioritize squishy targets to maximize your burst damage.
Utilize your W to catch out-of-position enemies or to peel for yourself and your teammates.
Plugin Features & Notes:

Q:
PVP:
- Combo, Harass mode checks. (Harass also with mana pct slider check). Spell won't be casted in their respectives modes unless these options are enabled.
- Q Through Wave If Possible: This option will make the script cast Q to a lane minion that is going to die by Q, instead of casting it to the target directly, so it can bounce with extra damage.
- Assisted Cast: Hotkey to assist cast. Extra checkbox -> Assisted Cast Champion Only (self explanatory).
PVE
- Last hit: To unkilable minions by auto attack check.
- Jungle Clear: Use for jungle check. 
- Lane Clear: This option will only work with aggro mode (fast clear) activated. 
- Apply Cast Restrictions: Option related to lane clear. This will prevent Q from being casted if the min kilable minions of the following slider restriction is not met.
W:
PVP:
- Request Cast Hotkey
- Prevent Inside AA Range: This option will make the script wait until you don't have more bullets left or the target leaves AA range to cast W.
- Combo & Harass checks, same like spell Q.
PVE:
- Lane Clear, Jungle Clear, Last Hit:
Lane clear only with aggro mode, like Q,
Last hit will be used to minions unkilable by AA or out of range.

E:
- On Immobile: This option will enable the script to cast E on immobile targets.
R:
- Enable spell checkbox. If desactivated, none of the following logics will work nor appear in menu.
- Shooting Mode:
    2 modes:
    --  Automatic: Will cast R to the closest to mouse target automatically.
    --  Keybind: Will cast R to the closest to mouse target, but only while the following keybind is pressed.
- Mouse Radius: This slider is the mouse radius that the script will take into account to get the best target.
- Draw Mouse Radius: This option will enable an indicative drawing of mouse radius to be drawn when casting R.
- Block Evade While Casting: Self explanatory. Evade will restore its previous state after R finishes cast.
- Block Orbwalker While Casting: Self explanatory. Manual clicks will still work.

NOTE: Jhin will wait for (0.5 - 1.5 seconds, depending on current situation) Q to be ready before shooting 4th auto attack. This behaviour can be overriden by pressing your aggro mode hotkey (LMB by default).
