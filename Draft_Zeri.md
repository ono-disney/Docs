Q - Burst Fire
Packet EXPLOIT - This feature is unique to Disney++, and will help you get a faster Q.
On essential, Q settings will be set to default plugin settings.
The advancing mode allows you to set a variety of configuration, but in Zeri's Q there is not much to set.
 
W - Ultrashock Laser
Safety Checks -  I leave everything default, but it allows you to set critical distance.
Advanced lets you configure a variety of settings how Q will be used. Here are some of the most important:
Hitchance mult: Here you can put the hit chance ( recommend, default 1.0 )
It also allows you to select or deselect the functions:
Allow Single Target
Allow Short Beam
Allow Long Beam
I recommend using all defaults.
E - Spark Surge
SPOTS KEYBIND - Place the key of your preference (This function is for you to jump over the walls where there are markings, just get on top of the circle and press the button you placed)
Automatic - I recommend using manual. For players who don't have much practice with champions I recommend using automatic
Advanced lets you configure a variety of settings how:
TOGGLE - This option will be added to the permashow and you can turn it on and off whenever you want.
Only Defensive Mode - When you activate the DEFENSIVE MODE, it will use the anti-gapclose E
Config
Default config is good, just make sure to set up preferred hotkeys for E - WALL JUMP  
Make sure that R Block Missing is enabled.
I put the automatic E off, because I prefer to use it manually, but it depends on each person's preference
PACKET EXPLOIT - ON - This will help you get an even faster Q.
Champion Guide
In my opinion, Zeri is one of the easiest champions to play scripted.
Zeri power spike is when she reaches level 6, so only try to farm until you get there, before that, just try to farm and not die.
In lane you may not be able to do risky plays if your support is not on the same page, but you can actually farm and poke pretty well on your own. Zeri is one of the easiest champions to farm, and with disney it makes it almost impossible to lose minions
 
You can always use your E over wall to avoid ganks and anyone trying to murder you, and this is something tht makes her extra safe against ganker junglers and engage supports.
 
How safe it is to pick her?
Zeri is an okay ADC to blind pick. She is safe, she scales and she can do well with most supports. She works best with enchanters who can empower her but that doesn't make other suports bad. Do remember though that enemy Slow+CC will make your games much harder, and thanks to her squishiness you also don't want to be picking her into a team with many assassins if you don't have a good support to peel for you.

RUNES 
Currently this is the most used rune for Zeri                     

But after the nerf it received in patch 13.8 I am preferring to use this one:         

 
Spell Order
Q>E>W - I always prefer to upgrade E after Q, because it will give you a shorter reload time, and you will be more mobility.
 
BUILD

 
Build Remarks 
- I currently prefer in patch 13.9 to start with CULL. (Since Zeri is a great champion to farm, this will give you a certain advantage)
- Use Navori or IE? The navori was nerfed but is still good for Zeri, as it greatly decreases the recharge time of his E in fights.
But in my opinion: 
Navori should be done when you need to use a lot of E in fights, when there are peasants who can stop you by jumping on you or giving you engage. Example: Jax.
 
IE should be done in all other situations.
