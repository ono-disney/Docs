Varus Guide
Important Info:
 - The way Varus Q is coded on Riots side makes some unique issues:
    -   Be careful pressing LMB while Varus is charging, as this will cancel it
    -   It’s very easy to accidentally cancel his Q with user inputs
    -   Avoid pressing Q manual, use Request Q instead
    -   Avoid pressing LMB while Q is charging
    -   Request-Q can be configured to your personal preference

How to Use
Defensive Mode: Cast E
Harass: Uses Q
Combo: Auto-R
Flash-R: hotkey
Request-Q:
Use this instead of manually pressing Q 
Turn on “Cast Anyway” in Request-Q settings
Adjustable W threshold, if you think W isn’t being used enough/too much
Config:
Default config is good for both AP and AD varus, just make sure to set up preferred hotkeys for Request-Q and Flash-R.

-   R as an override is the best method.
-   Block R is a good option too (will stop you casting it if no enemies are in range.)
-   Just leave it on essential, it works for all playstyles, just learn how to use it

Playstyle
Varus is considered one of the best blind pick ADCs. This is because he is incredibly versatile, he isn’t dependent on any particular support or team comp, and he doesn’t have any direct counterpicks. 

Varus can choose several different builds, and adapt to the enemy comp very easily. 

All of his playstyles are viable and strong, but it's important to know when you should go each build. (Don’t go crit builds). Varus heavily rewards good game knowledge, itemization and win con knowledge.

 

On-Hit

Lethality

AP

Runes:

Tempo

Comet / HoB

Tempo / HoB / First Strike

Spell:

Q>W>E

Q>E>W
(Start E > Q > W)

W > Q > E

(Point extra points in Q if you want more harass early)

Pros:

Versatile
Generally good
Dynamic build
Cheap and gold efficient items
Good defensive options
Building AP after rageblade+runaans is very strong
Frontloaded damage
Good vs high range comps
Strongest lane phase
Comet and E have the same cooldown, very obnoxious
Snowball potential
Strong dives/gank setup
Choke point control
Great siege/objective control
Oneshot tanks
Insane damage 
Best scaling
Cons:

Struggles vs high range comps
Struggles vs AllIn
Useless if behind
 Need to snowball
 Weak vs divers and tanks
Not as effective vs squishies 
 Expensive
 Backloaded damage
When to pick:

Very strong for front to back teamfighting
Works well with every support
Comet great vs double poke lanes

HoB + is strong vs All-In lanes (heavy trade level 1 and they can’t play the lane anymore)

Great at snowballing botlane and ending quickly

Melts tanks

Can build AP even in ADC role, if your team has a good mix of damage

When to avoid:

If you have a pick comp (eg: Vi + LeBlanc)

If the enemy has a stronger teamfight

When enemies will build armor in their first 2 items (shen, malphite, rammus)

At 4 items it’s generally worse than other builds, unless you’re very ahead

Vs Healers/Shielders like Soraka/Sona/Yuumi

Bad Vs divers and melee ADCs like Irelia,Yasuo, Tryndamere, Yone, who can easily get on top of you, and kill you before you get your damage off

(Crown builds can mitigate this)


If your team is AP heavy, especially your jungler.
