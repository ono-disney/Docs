Playstyle:
Tristana is best played aggressively all game, with a ganking jungler or engage support.
Tristana’s best role in the current meta is as a midlaner. Her level 3 powerspike is unmatched by any other meta midlaner, and she can generally force 1v1s for free in the early game. 


Tristana is especially strong when paired with an AP jungle, like Elise or Evelynn.
In order to get the most value from picking Tristana, you need to be pushing your early power, however, you also scale insanely well if you don’t fall behind.
Your goal in lane is to get as many plates as possible, this is why most Tristana players will take demolish in runes.

If you can’t solo kill your laner in the early game, don’t stress, as long you stay even with your laner, you will be more useful than them in midgame fights and skirmishes, just keep pressure on your lane by pushing for plates.

It’s quite easy to proc demolish if you time it correctly with your E, as the enemy won’t be able to harass you without taking significant damage from the AoE explosion, this takes some practice to get right.
