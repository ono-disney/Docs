Combo:

Normal Q : When it has a high hit change (will not spam the ability)
Requested Q: As usual you request more Qs with lmb.
Q spell has a mana slider.
Normal W: special logic, for now better use it yourself, dont rely on the script. Auto W will be used very sheldom
You have 2 mana sliders for W for ally and youself with on/off option.
Normal E: Will auto E to reset autoattack all the time when hitting an enemy champion.
Harras:

The abilities function the same as in combo.
Also obviously if there is no enemy to attack will try to last hit minions.
You can also set on/off for lashitting minions with Q.
Lane clear:

Attacks a lot trying to get lasthits. Does NOT use abilities unless you request with lmb
If you request lmb then its on Fast Clear: meaning it will push the wave as fast as possible.
When kayle is above 11 care using this mode because do to her pasive-E you may lose minions
R ability:

You can choose if you want auto R on yourself.
You can choose if you want auto R on any Ally.
You can choose which ally you DONT want to auto save with R. (the auto R only works if you are in range of the champion, for now it only has priority based on health)
