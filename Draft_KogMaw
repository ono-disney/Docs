Harass: Q (slow, more accurated)
Combo: Q W E (only high accuracy situations) R (only with certain stacks and situations)
Request R Hotkey - Will cast ultimate fast to the best posible target.
Spell E: Is meant to be casted only on defensive situations or extremly high hit chances like stun followup or dash. Dont expect it to be cast often.
Spell W: It meant to be casted as soon as you can land Auto Attack with it in Combo mode. Great for SBTW but if you want to have more control over the cooldown of the spell its recomended to play it manual.
