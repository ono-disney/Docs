Gameplay / Playstyle Tips:
Apply pressure to the lane as long as you know where is the enemy jungler and you are not in gank danger.

Abuse the previous applied pressure to allow your jungle take scuttles, drakes, setup invades or even dives.

Focus on keeping cs/min counter above 9 no matter what, take few jungle camps while doing rotations.

Hold aggressive hotkey (default lmb) when you are wining a fight and want to commit on chase, this way evade wont move you and in case its necessary Auto E will keep you covered.

Build Tips:
Berserker Greaves is a good item to get early as they enhance your orbwalking and evade.

  [ Kraken > Phantom Dancer > IE ] is optimal in most games

 Replace PD with BT if your support is Lulu / Ardent rush

 If you get ahead early, buy Serrated Dirk, and turn it into collector 2nd

Note this is a snowball build - only when ahead early and enemy team is abusable
