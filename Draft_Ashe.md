ASHE - CHAMPION

S

Ashe has advanced logic for W. She will avoid casting W if it will also hit the minion wave. Aggressive mode overrides safety checks and should cast W regardless. This can be changed in the advanced settings. Before using, set up hotkey requests for W and R.

 

Default (essential) settings are fine for every Ashe playstyle, not much configuration should be needed.
