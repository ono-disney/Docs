Q:
PVP:
- Combo, Harass mode checks. Harass will try to use E through wave to poke (E minion, Q+AA target, then Q back if possible / situation is good for it).
- Exploit: Only works when Q has one charge. (E + Q, instant tornado Q after without waiting for CD). Use at your own risk.
- Charge Tornado In Wave: This option will make the script cast Q after E to charge tornado, even if no heroes are around to be hit.
PVE
- Last hit: To unkilable minions by auto attack check.
- Jungle Clear: Use for jungle check. 
- Lane Clear: When tornado is ready, this option will only work with aggro mode (fast clear) activated. 
W:
- Auto W: Self explanatory. To dangerous missiles.
E:
- Combo and harass checks.
- Always To Mouse: This option will make the script cast E always towards mouse position. By default, E is casted to an automatically determined direction.
- Misc:
    -- Restrict Cast To Hotkey: If this option is enabled, E will only be casted while pressing the hotkey (hidden until the option is enabled).
    -- Prevent Under Tower: Will prevent E under tower, unless you are in aggro mode or you are already under tower.
    -- Semi-Manual Cast: Like manual cast but redirects the cast to the best target in range.
- Flee Options:
    -- Draw E Flee Indicator Through Wall: When this is enabled, an indicator showing if you can cross the wall or not after using E with a target will appear.
    -- Only Draw Indicator For Jungle: Self explanatory
    -- Flee Through Wall: When this hotkey is pressed, E will be casted to the closest to mouse enemy target that will make you cross the wall.
    -- Restrict Flee To Mouse Unit: Read in-game tooltip.
R:
(This spell will only work on combo mode)
- Auto R: Will automatically use R to targets if a suitable situation is found.
- Only While Pressing: Will prevent R usage unless this hotkey is pressed.
The script will delay R cast as long as possible, so you maximize your dps.
